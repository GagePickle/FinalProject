# Escape from Tarkov Item Tracker

This is a project aiming to assist players of the popular online game 'Escape from Tarkov'.

The main premise of the game is that you go into one of the maps, and try to find weapons, gear, and other items. Then get to one of the designated extraction points, to escape with the items you collected. These items can then be used in future runs, or be sold on the marketplace.

In the game you have a limited amount of space to carry the items you find. So it can be difficult to decide which items you want to take if you don't know their value, use, or rarity.

The application is designed to allow users to enter data for in game items, and have them displayed in a list for quick reference mid-game. In order to help them decide which items they should take with them.
